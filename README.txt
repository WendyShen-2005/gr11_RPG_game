Hints / shortcuts: 
- You can turn on infinite health in settings
- to skip to boss, go to prevGameData and change last line to "Boss Room"

Missing functions: 
- Intended 3-5 levels / maps, only ended up doing 1
- only 1 life

Additional functions: 
- dialogue
- spikes
- "aimed" projectiles (projectiles go towards mouse pos) and lazy, auto aiming 
system (j button)

bugs: 
- if you restrict an enemies movements too close to a wall, you can push the 
character out of bounds (specifically if we're pushed against up or left into a
wall)
- when a shockwave enemy first spawns, it won't play the sound effect
- if you stand in a laser (no moving), it will only deal one instance of dmg
rather than continous dmg
- turing on infinite hp does not heal
- !!IMPORTANT should run on high fps computer since I timed things with a frame
counter rather than an actual timer (especially with boss fight) (I know I should
have looked into actual timers, but I'm lazy)
- secret room cutscenes still play even if Skip Dialogue is on
- didn't have enough time to make program save num of items you have
- for some reason doesn't work if I set the first value in my save txt to "0"
(which I was hoping would mean the player never played before) it doesn't work
(even though I'm pretty sure it worked before)
